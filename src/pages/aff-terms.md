By signing up to be an affiliate in the Keyback Affiliate Program (the “Program”) you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “Terms”). Please ensure that you read them carefully before signing up. These Terms are a legal agreement between Eternal Digital Assets LLC, a company registered at 8 The Green, Suite B, Dover, Delaware 19901, United States. 'Keyback' is a brand asset owned and operated by Eternal Digital Assets (“Keyback”, "Eternal Digital Assets", “we”, “us”) and You (the “Affiliate”, “you”).

We reserve the right to update and change the Terms from time to time without notice. Any amendments, modifications, enhancements or changes to the Program including the release of new features and resources made available by us from time to time shall be subject to these Terms. Continued use of the Program after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms at any time at: https://affiliates.keyback.io/programs/keyback/tos/

Any violation of these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to be an Affiliate and forfeiture of any outstanding affiliate referral fee payments earned during the violation.

## Account Registration & Terms

You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the sign up process for an Affiliate account (“account”)

You must be 18 years of age or older to join this Program.

Each account is for use by either a single legal entity (e.g. a company or a partnership) or an individual user. We do not permit you to share your user name and password with any other person nor with multiple users on a network. Responsibility for the security of any user names and passwords issued (including those of any Invitees) rests with you.

You may not use the Program for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Program, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

## Referral Links & Promotion

Once you have signed up for the Program you will be provided with a URL link that must be used to identify you when placing a link from your site, email or other communications to the Keyback website. It is your responsibility to ensure each such link is correctly formatted.

We may also provide graphical images that can be used within the links to promote Keyback. You may not modify these images in any way. We reserve the right to change the images at any time without notice.

You will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of your site and for all materials that appear on your site

We may terminate the Agreement if any meaningful spam complaints naming us or our services result from your marketing activities.

You may not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement or your participation in the Program; such action may result in your termination from the Program. In addition, you may not in any manner misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you, say you develop our Services, say you are part of Keyback or express or imply any relationship between us and you or any other person or entity, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

## Referral Fees

For the sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must click-through a link from your site, email, or other communications to the Keyback website and sign up within 90 days of the initial click-through. If they fail to sign up within those 90 days and later return without following your link, you will not earn a referral fee.

We will only pay referral fees on links that are automatically tracked and reported by our systems. For our systems to track the referral, the visitor must have cookies enabled. We will not pay referral fees if someone says they signed up through you but it was not tracked by our system.

Keyback makes available at its discretion, other affiliate payout structures based on mutual agreement. All affiliate signups are renumerated at the base referral rate. The base referral rate is 20% of our revenue from the retail offering for customers that you refer. Referrals will be tracked in the Keyback Affiliate Admin System once the customer successfully pays the purchase/join fee. Referral fees are only earned if a customer makes a payment in full and remains active and without a chargeback or refund request for 30 days from end of the month in which the sale was tracked.

Bonuses can also be earned based on the number of customers per month. When an affiliate generates 10 or more conversions in a given calendar month, they earn a 10% bonus to their 20% commission (22% of retail). If an affiliate generates 20 or more conversions in a given calendar month, they earn a 20% bonus to their 20% commission (24% of retail).

Affiliates who refer other affiliates to join the Keyback Affiliate Program, will be eligible to receive 10% per retail sale on the sales of first level affiliates and 5% per retail sale on the second level affiliates.

## Payment

We only make payment in cryptocurrency. There are four options: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Please make sure you add a VALID public address for ONE and only one of these types of cryptocurrency. If you enter public addresses for more than one then we will make a selection for you. If you only want payment to BTC make sure you leave the other options blank.

Accrued referral fees are paid once per month on a NET30 basis. This means sales commissions are paid 30 days from the end of the month they were generated. For example a sale generated via your affiliate referral link on January 1st and another on January 31st will both be accounted and paid for within 10 days of March 1st.

All affiliates must have a valid account as a requirement on payment, and it must be on file with us via the Affiliate Admin System. You are responsible for ensuring these payment details are correct and current. We are not responsible for payment to a wrong address based on affiliate negligence.

Customer payments refunded or payments charged-back due to credit card fraud do not qualify for referral fees. We may delay crediting of referral fees subject to risk analysis considerations and Anti-Money Laundering procedures.

A summary of sign ups and statement of referral fees is available to the Affiliate by logging into their Affiliate Admin System.

The referral fee structure is subject to change at our discretion.

We reserve the right to disqualify referral fees earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, charges, levies, assessments and other fees of any kind imposed on your involvement in this Agreement and shall be the responsibility of, and payable by you.

We reserve the right to check and change commissions on the basis of orders actually paid, the notification e-mail or tracked sale is not understood as a confirmed commission until NET30. Every payment will be verified based on real transactions and tracked sales and commissions may by updated manually to reflect orders both successful, cancelled, refunded and fraudulent. In order for a valid sale to be paid a commission the customer must remain active and not cancel or chargeback within 30 days from the end of the month the sale was made.
