We are a group of crypto enthusiasts, investors, traders, creators, developers and entrepreneurs who wondered aloud ... 'where is my crypto backup?'

We set about creating a system that securely and in a decentralized way, backed up our crypto. But we wanted it to be simple and easy to understand and use. Not for geeks and programmers. For normal crypto peeps.

And then we wanted to be able to pass that crypto backup on to our wives, husbands, girlfriends, boyfriends, significant others, pets, charities ...

When we pop off the face of the earth, which most of us will do at some point, we're gonna need a solution for passing it on, right?

So over a period of about 3 years we came up with Keyback. We're always building, refining, adding new stuff. We're dedicated to its success and in making it totally rock solid in every way.

If you have any questions, comments, insights, bug reports, or musings, [contact us](https://keyback.io/contact) or submit a ticket [here](https://keyback.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new).

We hope to welcome you to our Keyback family ðŸ˜€
