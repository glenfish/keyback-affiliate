At Keyback, we want our customers to receive top value for their money. But we understand that sometimes there's not a one size fits all solution. Try us out and see if we're a good fit for your digital asset recovery and estate management.

We offer a 30 day no questions refund policy on Keyback. There is absolutely zero risk to you for kicking the tires.

Access to our tools for encryption and decryption remain a benefit of membership. Please be aware that if you have encrypted your Master File you will need an active Keyback membership for decryption functionality. Note that we can only refund by the payment method you used to join. In the case of Bitcoin, we will require you to confirm this address prior to refund.
