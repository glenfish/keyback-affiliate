        It's so easy to lose access to your digital assets. These are just a few real world examples of how it can
        happen. Whether you're a big banking family, tech mogul or entrepreneur.

            In 2017 Musk noted that someone had sent him part of a bitcoin years ago, but he had no idea where it was
            anymore. While this is surely not a major concern for Elon, it proves the point it doesn't matter who you
            are. Without your keys, there's no crypto wealth.

            He passed away unexpectedly without haved shared access to millions of dollars in crypto ties to his
            business. He joked about storing crypto keys in a bank deposit box and in a safe in the rafters of the
            attic. He was the only person with knowledge of keys at the time of his passing.
